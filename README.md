Welcome to the pig latin project !

## Guide

Ok for those who don't know what is pig latin, let me explain it to you.

Pig Latin is a secret language formed from English by transferring the initial consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable.

Didn't Understand ? Here are simpler rules.....

- Let's take the word ```pig``` which would get translated into ```ipay```.
- And let's take the word ```enlarge``` which would get translated into ```enlargeyay```

Did you notice what happens ? You would think that some bizarre word is spitted out, but no, here is how it works...

Here are the rules...

- When there is a vowel at the starting the word, then the suffix ```yay``` would be added.
- but when there is a constant at the starting of the word, then it would cut the entire consonant cluster till it gets the vowel and stops. now the cut word is going to be attached to the last of the word and the suffix ```yay``` would be added.

Examples...

```egg``` becomes ```eggyay```


```pig``` becomes ```igpay```.
